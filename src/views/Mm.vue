        program, DAO of core developers propose to launch a program to support
        traders. For the Robonomics community, developers offer a reward of 35
        XRT per week for every 1% weekly XRT / ETH Uniswap Volume.

        <b>Event details.</b> Suppose you swap 20 ETH and 500 XRT to the both
        sides from June 18th to June 24th, and your impact is 3% of weekly
        trading volume. Reward calculation: 3% of Volume * 35 XRT/ per 1% = 105
        XRT. And it lasts every week for market makers. The event starts with an
        announcement in the chat of the Robonomics community and will last
        indefinitely, but not less than a month. Join now!
